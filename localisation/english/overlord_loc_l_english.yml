WAR_NAME_GER_AEF:0 "Operation: Overlord"
subordinate_command:0 "Subordinate Command"
AEF_faction_name:0 "Allied Expeditionary Force"
WACHT_BOOKMARK_NAME:0 "Wacht Am Rhein - COMING SOON"
KS_BOOKMARK_NAME:0 "Kaiserschlacht - COMING SOON!"
ALLIES_KS_DESC:0 "With their ally in the Russian Empire out of the war, the prospect of facing Germany's eastern formations is naught but a certainty. It is clear that the Germans are planning one last attack. One final charge. Resisting this inevitable offensive is now the Entente's top priority. Following a successful defense, a counter-attack can be launched to bring Germany to its knees and end this terrible war.\n\nFurthermore, American 'doughboys' are now arriving to the front in their thousands. The end of this war is in sight."
GER_KS_DESC:0 "Battered by four long years of brutal attritional warfare, and hampered by a damaging Royal Navy blockade, the German Empire's chances of long-term victory in the Great War appear slimmer by the day.\n\nThere is however a glimmer of hope for the Kaiserreich. Formations freed up from the East are now arriving. The plan? To use them with devastating force against the enemy.\n\nA successful offensive now will surely force Britain and France to the negotiating table.."
KS_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "The defeat of Russia in the East has freed up a large number of German formations for use in the West. However, time is of the essence. As American and other Allied troops pour into Europe, the window of victory for Germany is slim - and closing. A final, decisive offensive is needed.\n\nCan the Entente withstand the last-ditch German offensive into France? Or will the German Empire finally initiate a new glorious chapter in its history?"
WACHT_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "Following a surprise German offensive into Belgium, the over-extended Allied Expeditionary Force has been driven back.\nAs the frontlines now settle, a small holdout of American paratroopers in Bastogne preoccupies the German forces. This pocket will need to be destroyed before further advancements can be made. Undersupplied, outnumbered and out-gunned, it now seems that the besieged Americans are the sole thing between the Germans and a total reversal on the Western Front..."
GER_WACHT_DESC:0 "Having achieved complete surprise in the Ardennes Offensive, dogged resistance in Bastogne now threatens the entire plan. This must be dealt with as soon as possible.\n\n Once the pocket is destroyed, the Germans can move forward, splitting the Allies in two, then driving the Allied Expeditionary Force back into the sea!\n\n .Surrounded and without supply, the tiny garrison of Bastogne cannot last long. With its destruction, the gates to total victory will open..."
AEF_WACHT_DESC:0 "The stunning speed of the Allied advance into Europe does have its downsides. The supply chain, now dangerously over-extended, is barely capable of supplying its forces. Now the Allies face a full-blown German offensive into the Ardennes region. \n\nOn the heels of the failed Market Garden operation, there is naught the Allies can do save play for time. If the lines can just hold, reinforcements and supplies can be brought up to the front. A victory in the Battle of the Bulge could surely open the way into Germany itself..."
EA_NAME:0 "European Assault"
EA_DESC:0 "For years, the Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin has called for a second front to be launched against the Germans. Now, with the planning for 'Overlord' having begun, this dream can now become a reality.\n The Germans in Nazi occupied France are only faintly aware of these plans, endeavouring to fortify the entirety of their coast. But will they be able to guess where the final blow will land? Or will Operation: Overlord spell the final end of the German Reich?"
ITB_NAME:0 "Into The Breach - COMING SOON"
ITB_DESC:0 "Operation: Overlord is done. The Battle of Normandy is about to begin.\nBy 1200 on June 6, Allied forces had secured a decent foothold on numerous beaches in Normandy. The Germans, reeling from this sudden and surprise invasion, must gather with all haste for an immediate counter attack.\nThe Allies' foothold in Northern France is at best tenuous.  can the German Army mobilise fast enough to repel this sudden, seaborne invasion? Or is the fate of the German Reich sealed?"
AEF_ITB_DESC:0 "Allied forces have landed in Europe. Operation Overlord has begun. \n\nShortly after the first landings, we must now secure beachheads, capture ports, and push the Germans back. Despite a scattered drop, our paratroopers have managed to secure key positions behind the beaches. But with many of our prelaid plans going out of the window, we have no choice but to press forward into the enemy. What's more, it is clear a German counter-attack could come - one with the potential to drive our forces back in to the sea..."
GER_ITB_DESC:0 "It is the invasion. With Field Marshal Rommel away in Paris, and a complete lack of direction from Führerheadquarters, the scattered German units in and around Normandy are in many ways isolated.\n\n With Allied paratroopers cutting lines of communications, initiative must be taken if there is any chance of throwing this invasion back into the sea. The time has come to fight for your worth - and the fate of Germany hangs in the balance..."
CLASSIFIED_NAME:0 "CLASSIFIED!"
POLITICS_MONTY_DESC:0 "As one of the few true 'heroes' the British possessed in the war, Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery was the United Kingdom's main candidate for the position of Supreme Commander. While many have criticised his overly cautious attitude to generalship, few can deny the electric effect he had on his men's morale, galvanising support from the soldiers on the ground to the army's overall goals.\n\nHowever, Monty's attitude towards those he worked with in positions of senior command made things very difficult. Montgomery was notoriously hard to work with, especially with Americans and those with whom he shared disagreements (which there were many!).\n\nIn the end, historically speaking, it was the Americans' insistence (given that they were providing more or less half of all the resources for Overlord) that an American be made Supreme Commander."
POLITICS_MARSHALL_DESC:0 "Other than Ike and Monty, the only other candidate with a realistic chance of becoming the Allied Supreme Commander was George Marshall. He was favoured by FDR due to Marshall's close ties to the president. However, It was eventually Eisenhower's experience laeding the naval landings of Torch and Husky, as well as the curious political situation involving Eisenhower and Marshall. Had Marshall become Supreme Commander, then FDR would have undoubtedly made Eisenhower his chief of staff. Thus, Eisenhower would have effectively 'swapped' positions with his former boss."
GER_EA_DESC:0 "An Allied invasion of Europe is fast approaching. \n To meet this threat, Hitler has ordered the construction of an 'Atlantic Wall' - a series of defenses stretching from Norway down to the French-Spanish coast.\n\n Despite lacking in ground formations at this time, the Westheer must be adequately prepared for the coming invasion. In due time, a designated formation will be dispatched to the north of France.\n\n Until that time, we can only prepare for the inevitable Allied attack..."
AEF_EA_DESC:0 "The Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff have given the go-ahead for a new operation: Overlord. To do this, the organisation of COSSAC, along with a new Allied Expeditionary Force, has been created. But without any defined plans, and lacking a solid structure of leadership, the plans for Overlord remain in their infancy.\n\n A successful Overlord will require miracles of brains, brawn, and blood - and as the Germans continue preparing their Atlantic Wall, it is clear a strong and decisive leader is needed to drive COSSAC forward..."
#AEF_EA_DESC:0 "The Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force is the unification of dozens of countries' military forces in the North-West of Europe. Their goal is simple - the liberation of Europe from Nazi tyranny. \nTo this end, the land, sea, and air forces of sixteen countries have come together for this ultimate goal. But the task ahead will not be easy. Hitler has enjoyed total mastery of mainland Europe for years. A seaborne invasion of occupied France or any other place would take an unprecedented effort, requiring miracles of brains, brawn, and blood. But with the combined might of the Allies, what can go wrong?"

While American formations like those at Omaha Beach and Utah stormed across Normandy and into France, those commanded directly by Montgomery appeared to...slacken and slow.\n\nWhile this notion may be partially true it is also the case that the concentration of German units in and around Caen - particularaly Panzer units - was scarcely seen in the war, even in the Eastern Front. In addition caution was far more befitting of the BRitish whom, after long years of war, simply did not have the manpower reserves to maintain the large, sweeping offensives that the Americans could."

AEF_COSSAC_organisation:0 "Combined Chiefs of Staff"
POLITICS_COSSAC_ORG_DESC:0 "Following the successes of Operation Husky and Operation Torch, the requirement for a cross-channel invasion into France (and by extension Germany) was agreed upon by the British and American CCS (Combined Chiefs of Staff). As such, they deigned to create the 'COSSAC' - The Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander. While a Supreme Allied Commander could be appointed later, the first task of the CCS would be to appoint the COSSAC."
POLITICS_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "Seen as the natural choice for Supreme Commander, Dwight 'Ike' Eisenhower's likeable nature endeared him greatly to those he worked with, and made him a popular figure among those he commanded. He proved to be a more than capable commander, with an impressive ability to gel the often bickering and fractious factions within SHAEF together. Having already commanded two seaborne invasions in the Casablanca and Sicily landings of 1943, Eisenhower's experience leading cross-channel assaults also helped soldiify him as the natural choice for Supreme Commander."
POLITICS_MORGAN_DESC:0 "Frederick Morgan's appointment as COSSAC signified the birth of the COSSAC organisation. Prior to the appointment of a SUpreme Commander, it was Morgan who drove forward plans for Overlord, exercising in many ways the very same authority that the future Supreme Commander would wield."
POLITICS_RUNSTEDT_DESC:0 "At the age of 68 (as of 1944), many would argue that Gerd von Rundstedt was far too old to hold the position of OB West. Nonetheless, Rundstedt proved to be a good general.\n\n Having experienced an Allied naval invasion in Sicily, Rundstedt had first-hand experience of the effects of Allied naval and air dominance. As such, he believed that the best way to tackle 'Overlord' would be to let the Allies advance inward, to out-run their supply lines, whereupon the Wehrmacht could inflict a harsh blow on the over-extended attacker, while simultaneously remaining beyond the range of the powerful Allied naval artillery."
POLITICS_ROMMEL_DESC:0 "Like many German generals, Erwin Rommel's nature was to favour the attack. So when Hitler placed him in command of Army Group B and tasked him with both repelling an Allied naval invasion and to oversee construction of the Atlantic Wall, Rommel found himself unable to pursue the aggressive and highly mobile war in which he was so accustomed.\n\nDespite this, Rommel still believed that only through attacking could the invasion be repelled. His strategy - in which he strongly believed - was that an amphibious invasion was at its weakest when it first lands upon the shore. As such, Rommel planned to launch a swift and immediate counter-attack in order to drive it back into the sea. His nickname 'The Great Asparagus'"

salvage_local_equipment_idea_desc:0 "The losses suffered by Germany over the years of war were nothing short of immense. As such, it was common that German units would utilise scavenged and captured equipment. French tanks from the battles of 1940 were utilised on the Western Front.

In many cases, units in Normandy would take orders from three different sources - Rommel as commander of Army Group B, Rundstedt as OB west, and Hitler as Führer." 
#This lack of cohesive control led to the Germans having many problems. Ironically, the 'divided' and 'quarreling' democracies in the form of the Allies had no such problem, delegating all power in the Overlord campaign to the Supreme Allied Commander."

In order to successfully invade France, a vast amount of men and resources would need to be shipped across the channel. To do this, large quantities of landing craft would be required. This was further hampered by the great need (and often priority) of the Pacific theater in acquiring landing craft for island-hopping operations."

aef.1.t:0 "'Overlord' Set For 1944"
aef.1.d:0 "Ever since the British were forced to abandon France at Dunkirk in 1940, the solemn knowledge that the Allied Nations would one day return to the continent and liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny was set deep into our minds.\n\nNow, the time is finally arriving. The Combined Chiefs of Staff have given the go-ahead for Overlord in the year of 1944. And so, now we must prepare.\n\nThis undertaking will not be a simple one. Great innovations, impeccable planning, and incredible leadership will be required to not only shore up the Allies as a team, but also to make such a cross-channel invasion possible.\n\nWhile the Germans may have a numerical advantage over us, we hold the advantage in intelligence. Ultra intercepts allow us to know what the Germans plan almost before they do. What's more, our near complete control of the sea and air allows us to choose the point which Overlord will fall. The initiate lies in our hands. We must use this advantage and take the Germans by complete surprise. Our superior intelligence, as well as an overwhelming air, sea, and industrial advantage, must be pressed for our operation to be a success.\n\nAnd it must be a success. At this point, Overlord cannot afford to fail. For if we are driven back, we risk the Soviets pushing across Europe from the East, and replacing one form of tyranny for another.\n\nWe have placed our full trust in you, commander, to carry out the necessary preparations. Good luck, and godspeed."
aef.1.a:0 "It will be done."
aef.2.t:0 "Appointing The COSSAC"
aef.2.d:0 "In March of 1943, Frederick E. Morgan was appointed as the Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander. As more and more resources were put towards Overlord, a fully-fledged body was soon created, which Morgan christened COSSAC.\n\nThis organisation was responsible for driving forward much of the early planning of Operation Overlord, with Morgan himself exercising much of the authority of the yet to be appointed Supreme Commander."
aef.2.a:0 "Very well."
aef.3.t:0 "Planning Overlord"
aef.3.d:0 "The time has come to put forward plans for Operation: Overlord. Our staff in COSSAC have put together a number of possible plans for the invasion - but we are yet undecided. We need you to have the final say.\n\nWhich invasion plan shall we pursue? (MORE COMING SOON)"
aef.3.a:0 "A naval invasion, supported by airborne troops and aerial bombardments."
aef.3.b:0 "An airborne invasion, supported by a feinting naval invasion."
aef.3.c:0 "Incite an uprising in France, and then take advantage."
aef.4.t:0 "Appointing The Supreme Commander"
aef.4.d:0 "The time has come to appoint a Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Now, as the Americans are providing a great deal of equipment and men for the invasion, they expect an American general to take the reigns of the invasion. \n\n George Marshall, head of the American Army, has excellent leadership skills and a good relationship with the US President. However, his 'people' skills may not be quite as well suited to bringing the Allies together as another candidate.\n\n The other candidate the Americans have put forward is Dwight D. Eisenhower, a soft-spoken yet charismatic leader, with experience in commanding the naval invasions of Operation Torch and Operation Husky. 'Ike' is well-liked by all parties in the Allied Expeditionary Force, and would make creating a single cohesive attacking force a simple affair. Some, however, believe Ike's actual generalship is not up to par compared to other candidates.\n\n Finally, the British have also put forward their candidate, their hero Bernard Montgomery. Loved by his men, there is no doubt Monty would invigorate the morale of our troops. However, his difficult attitude has made him a divisive figure, and he would no doubt be difficult to work with across the Alliance. There is no doubt our cohesiveness would suffer.\n\n Who should become Supreme Commander?"
aef.4.a:0 "Monty."
aef.4.b:0 "Marshall."

aef.5.t:0 "Statement No. 1"
aef.5.d:0 "At 10am on June 6th, the BBC issued the following message: 'Under the command of General Eisenhower, allied naval forces, supported by strong air forces, began landing allied armies this morning on the northern coast of France.'\n\nThis was the first public broadcast regarding the invasion, meaning the Allied invasion of Nazi occupied Europe was now official."
aef.6.t:0 "Disagreement Between Officers"
aef.6.d:0 "A serious row has broken out between two British and American junior officers. Citing personal and operation differences, the two officers are causing a great deal of disruption, albeit on a localised scale. If this row is allowed to spiral out of control, it could damage the cohesion of the A.E.F further. We have been called in to mediate a solution to their disagreement."

aef.11.t:0 "The Soviets Have Ignored Our Objections"
aef.11.d:0  "Our failure to push foward is being taken advantagae of by the Soviets. Now, disregarding previous post-war settlements, they are pushing forward and declaring the 'total liberation of the European continent from oppressive and obsolete systems of goverment.'\n\n This appears to be nothing short of a direct provocation! There now lies before us a terrible choice. We must fulfill our promise to the peoples of Europe - to free them from Tyranny.

aef.13.t:0 "The French Object To Our Bombing Strategy"
aef.13.d:0 "Our bombing campaign to disrupt and destroy German-controlled infrastructure is causing a great deal of destruction to the French civilian population currently living under the Nazi yoke. That is not to mention the collateral damage of our indiscrimate bombing campaigns.\n\nThe French have warned us that we absolutely must take more care in our operations from now on."

aef.19.a:0 "Reprimand. Send the offender back to the United States."

aef.19.d:0 "Apparently bored of 'waiting' and 'doing nothing' whilst waiting for the invasion to commence, a drunken orderly officer of our Intelligence division has been drunkenly bragging to complete strangers in a London pub. Potential secrets regarding Overlord have now been divulged in a public setting.\n\nWe must deal with this at once, or risk our plans being revealed."
aef.20.t:0 "Reports of Disillusionment With High Level Command"
aef.20.d:0 "Citing poor decision-making by our high-level commanders, many of our servicemen in the A.E.F are reportedly becoming disillusioned and discontented with the manner in which the A.E.F is being run. We need to alleviate these fears, lest they grow any worse."
aef.20.a:0 "Have [AEF.Getleader] hold a rousing speech."
aef.20.b:0 "Weekend passes revoked!"
aef.20.c:0 "[AEF.Getleader] will visit the troops."
aef.21.t:0 "NCOs Have Mutinied Against Their Company Commander!"
aef.21.d:0 "Citing poor leadership that will 'get them killed in France', a number of senior and Junior NCO's have carried out an act of mutiny, in sending letters of resignation to their battalion commander. While they are obviously discontented with their poor leader, their disregard of the chain of command should not also go unpunished.\n\n How shall we  deal with these mutineers?"
aef.21.a:0 "Quietly reassign the leader in question and punish the offenders with a slap on the wrist."
aef.21.b:0 "This is blatant insubordination! Court-martial and firing squad!"
aef.22.t:0 "Presenting The Final Plan"
aef.22.d:0 "SHAEF reports it has concluded planning for Overlord. With the plan now set, all that remains is to approve it and set the date. To that, we leave to you, Commander."
aef.22.a:0 "Let us commence our plan!"
aef.23.t:0 "Consult James Stagg"
aef.23.d:0 "Originally a civilian weather expert, James Stagg was given a military rank - Squadron Leader (the equivalent of Major in the ground-based armed forces branches) in order to give him a degree of authority in the military circles in which he would inevitably be working.\n\nIt was information from Stagg that ultimately caused the delay of the real-life D-Day from June 5 to June 6 (on account of the weather reports.)"
aef.23.a:0 "He will serve the Allies well."
aef.24.t:0 "Survey The Coastline"
aef.24.d:0 "For our landings to be a success, we must investigate and survey the potential coastlines upon which we wish to launch our invasion.\n\nGreat care must be taken, for if our operation is discovered, the Germans will glean vital clues into our intentions in Overlord.\n\nPerhaps we should launch a 'diversionary' investigation, which will throw them off the scent. For now, commander, the final say in where to survey lies with you."
aef.24.a:0 "Normandy."
aef.24.b:0 "Brittany."
aef.24.c:0 "Calais."
aef.24.dd:0 "Belgian coast."
aef.25.t:0 "Choosing A Landing Site"
aef.25.d:0 "Regardless how we plan to undertake Overlord, we must choose where we will land our troops. This choice will not be an easy one. \n\n The most obvious choice (and as such the one the Germans will fortity the most) is Calais, given its close proximity to Southern England and the short distance to Paris and the German V-2 sites in the Benelux. Perhaps, however, we can double-bluff the Germans into thinking we would never take such an obvious choice.\n\n Another option is the Netherlands itself. Landings into Zeeland would never be anticipated by the Germans, and, wit hthe support of our mighty navy, we could close off much of Zeeland and gain an effective foothold on teh continent easily. However, this would place us in an awkward position in terms of the rest of the theater.\n\nThe coast of Belgium is another one the Germans are likely to expect. This is due to the proximity to their V-2 rocket sites, as well as the easy access to key positions in the Benelux and, eventually, Paris.\n\n Further south, the coast of Normandy and the Cotentin Peninsula present an interesting opportunity. The Germans would likely not expect such a location due to its proximity to places like Calais, however the Cotentin Peninsula shields Normandy from a lot of the rough English channel weather. In addition, ports like Cherbourg and Cabourg could be seized relatively quickly.\n\nFinally, a landing at Brittany would be undoubtedly difficult, given the distance from there to Paris and Berlin beyond. However, such a landing may be inconcievable to the Germans.\n\nThe leadership of the AEF is yet to decide which place to land - and so the final say goes to you. Where shall we make our primary landings in Overlord?"

Soon our troops will land upon the shore and begin the liberation of Europe!\n\nDon't forget to check your decisions tab - a successful D-Day landing is required to progress the focus tree further!"
aef.25.de:0 "Brittany."
aef.28.t:0 "Aces In Exile"
aef.28.d:0 "Most famously in the Battle of Britain, volunteer pilots from nations such as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Belgium volunteered for service as pilots in the RAF. During the Battle of Britain, nearly 1,000 pilots from 16 countries served in the RAF. During Operation Overlord, so numerous were these volunteers from Poland, Czechoslovakia and even Norway, that special squadrons of the RAF were formed for them, flying mainly Hurricane and Spitfire fighters."
aef.28.a:0 "A welcome addition to the Allies."
aef.29.t:0 "Carrying Out Coastline Surveys"
aef.29.d:0 "If we are to invade France, we must learn more about the coastlines of the country. Will the beaches support our tanks? Will our troops be bugged down by waterlogged, uneven ground. The only way to find out is by carrying out coastline surveys.\n\nThe trouble with this, however, is that it makes it pretty obvious where we are going to invade... unless we carry out multiple, diversionary raids - and use the XX system to tell the Germans exactly what we're doing."

If something is not done soon, the Allied Expeditionary Force will face dire consequences. We must remind ourselves that, afterall, we are all on the same team.\n\nTherefore, [AEF.Getleader] has called for a meeting of all key figures of the Combined Chiefs. So far, this is limited to just the British and Americans.\n\nIt has been suggested that, for the first time, we invite the French (and perhaps our other Allies as well)."
aef.31.a:0 "We don't need the approval of the French."

aef.33.a:0 "Unfortunate."
aef.34.t:0 "Continued Losses Are Troubling The Population"
aef.34.d:0 "As our casualties continue to mount in the Northern French theater, concerns over the tactics used and the rate of attrition our forces are suffering has not gone unnoticed. More and more families are growing tired of the demands of the war.\n\nWe now stand at risk of public opinion turning against our offensive!"

aef.35.d:0 "The promises made by both senior members of the AEF and the governments of the various Allied nations are not being fulfilled. The cost of winning the war, for more and more people, is becoming too high.\n\nAs it stands, popular opinion has more or less completely turned against the war. It is clear that a significant turnaround will be necessary to undo this damage."

aef.36.t:0 "The General Public's Good Will Has Run Out"
aef.36.d:0 "Disgusted by the rate of loss in the Northern French Theater, the general public has now lost all faith in the Allied cause and, while they still hold a great degree of support for the overall war effort, morale and hope has been all but lost."

With the ongoing apalling rate of loss in Northern France there is no question that the public opinion of this war has turned.\n\nNo longer do our people support the cause in which we fight. We are facing the risk of backlash which we have not seen before.\n\nWe need results in France now, or risk grave consequences."

Now, the new government wishes to enter peace talks with the hopes of attaining a separate, conditional peace with us.\n\nAccepting German terms for a peace will enrage the Soviets, who will then have to contend with Germany alone. However, this will bring the war in Europe to an end and potentially save thousands, if not millions, of lives.\n\nHow do we respond?"

Their concerns rise primarily from the damage to French civilian industry.\n\nSo important was is this issue to the Supreme Commander, however, that he has threatened to resign from his post should he not be given full control of the RAF's bomber command in preparation for the invasion!\n\nAs a direct result of this, the CCS has allowed Bomber Command to fall under the jurisdiction of the A.E.F.\n\nControl of the RAF's strategic bombers is now yours, commander."

Lacking trust in French codes (which ahve been historically poor), the Allies have been reluctant to share too much information regarding the secret plans of Overlord, lest they fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\n This lack of trust is certainly felt by the French, and it cannot be forgotten that it is their home country that the Allies seek to liberate."

Patton, while in command of American forces in Italy, slapped an officer who was suffering from symptoms of battle stress.\n\n In light of this, demands are now being made that Patton, one of the A.E.F's finest commanders, be sent home in disgrace!\n\nOn the one hand, Patton's no-nonsense attitude and great leadership has made him something of a hero to his men. However, it is this same no-nonsense attitude that makes him difficult to work with in the eyes of the more senior members of the AEF. There's no doubt the overall cohesion of the AEF would improve if he were to go. But the morale of our men may suffer. \n\nWhat shall we do?"

aef.48.d:0 "The contribution of Belgium to the D-Day invasion is respectable, and often overlooked. During the Normandy Campaign, there were three RAF squadrons operated by Belgian airmen. In addition, 2,200 troops of the 1st Infantry Brigade arrived in August of 1944. A total of 4,500 troops operated under the Belgian government in exile, in close cooperation with Britain.In addition, many Belgians were recruited into the elite No. 10 Inter-Allied Commando.\n\nDuring the planning phase of Overlord, the Belgians were consulted on important information regarding the nature of their country and its people. This was done in order to give the Allies the maximum amount of information on the lands they were about to liberate."

aef.49.t:0 "The Netherlands in D-Day"
aef.49.d:0 "The German occupation of the Netherlands - which had been in place since 1940 - bore a heavy toll on the Dutch people. This prompted a large and significant resistance network, the likes of which rose to prominence on a level almost on par with that of the French Resistance. Just like the French, the Dutch resistance were able to feed the Allies information covertly, supplementing that of the Ultra itnercepts and their already stellar intelligence networks.\n\nIn addition to this, the Dutch committed around 1,200 men of the Prinses Irene Regiment to the Normandy campaign. This unit attained an impressive record during the war and was involved directly in the liberation of the Netherlands during and after Operation: Market Garden."
aef.50.t:0 "Poland in D-Day"
aef.50.d:0 "The most immediate contribution of the Polish forces in exile during the Normandy campaign was in terms of their air forces. Already famous for their efforts during the Battle of Britain, Polish aviators once again served with the RAF during D-Day, forming a number of fighter and strategic bomber squadrons.There is no doubt the extra skilled pilots Poland provided aided the RAF, whom would have been undoubtedly weary after five years of constant fighting.\n\nIn addition, the 1st Polish Armoured division arrived in Normandy a short time after D-Day, utilising the excellent new Sherman Firely tanks. While unable to directly liberate their homeland, this division played a large role in the liberation of Western Europe and, just like the other exiled nations' units, attained a very impressive record during the Normandy campaign.\n\nBorne from a long history of occupation and oppression by foreign powers, the Polish airmen and soldiers that took part in D-Day represented a fighting spirit that persists in Poland even today."
aef.50.a:0 "Poland is not yet lost."
aef.51.t:0 "Norway in D-Day"
aef.51.d:0 "The Norwegian contribution to D-Day lay primarily in its naval forces. The Norwegian navy in exile at this time numbered around 10 ships, with 1,000 sailors. The Svenner, a Norwegian destroyer, was actually the first Allied ship to be sunk during Operation: Neptune - by mines.\n\nIn addition to its navy, the Norwegians also operated a number of squadrons within the RAF, as well as supplying recruits to No. 10 Inter-Allied Commando.\n\nUnfortunately, the Norwegian Army itself was mostly unable to escape the Norwegian occupation, instead joining the resistance there."

aef.52.a:0 "Interesting..."
aef.52.d:0 "To mixed Allied reactions, Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud have formed a new provisional Free French government, directly challenging the 'illegitimate' Vichy regime.\n\nWhile Britain and the United States view this body as a mere wartime entity and not a precursor to a fully-fledged government, it is clear that popular support in France is growing for both de Gaulle and Giraud. Should the CFLN grow - and France be freed - it could very well mature into a fully-fledged governing body.\n\nThe Allied response to this has been muted. It is clear that a great deal of mistrust still exists between senior Free French figures - mainly Charles de Gaulle - and the likes of FDR and Churchill."
aef.53.d:0 "With full support from the rest of the Allies, Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud have formed a new provisional Free French government, directly challenging the 'illegitimate' Vichy regime.\n\nThe rest of the Allies clearly see this as a move to restore a fully fledged free French government, to replace that of the Vichy puppet regime. Increased support from the Allies has made this process easier than perhaps it would have been otherwise. Popular support for the CFLN in France is growing - as is its membership.\n\nThe effects of the support of the Allies, particularly Britain and the United States, is unclear at this stage. De Gaulle's suspicion over the Allies is well-known, who believes that Churchill and Roosevelt have designs on the French, particularly their extensive colonial empire."

Our various intelligence sources indicate the invasion could come anywhere from Norway down to the French border with Spain.\n\nLuckily for you, commander, you have been charged with the defence of Northern France. From Brittany in the West to Arnsberg and Switzerland in the East, we must defend this sector and prevent the Allies from staging a successful naval invasion.\n\nWhile it is true that the Allied naval and air supremacy gives them an unprecedented advantage - and the initiative - our numerical advantage means that, once we know where the invasion is, we can bring an unimaginable amount of force to bear upon the enemy, driving them back into the sea.\n\nOur usage of the 'Ost' battalions gives us the ability to rapidly acquire more manpower - however, the fighting morale of these troops is the focus of near constant question from those who command them.\n\nBetween you and me, commander, there is another issue we must contend with on the front. The Führer wishes to impose his will on all things regarding the conduct of the war.While his judgement is often sound, his will is sometimes...questionable.

ger.5.d:0 "Like many German generals, Erwin Rommel's nature was suited towards highly aggressive action. As in France and North Africa, it was a highly mobile, near constant offensive that suited Rommel.\n\nWith this in mind, When he found himself tasked with effectively sitting behind a line of mighty fortifications in the form of the Atlantic Wall, Rommel approached the problem in the only way he knew how - to attack.\n\nAs such, Rommel's plan was to hold the panzers in reserve, close to the beaches. Once the Allies invaded, a swift and brutal counter-attack could be launched, when the landing force was at its weakest.\n\nHe disagreed with Rundstedt's plan, fearing that both disrupted infrastructure and Allied air power would prevent the movement of German units around France once the invasion began.\n\nAs per Rommel's plan, it is vital we fortify the Atlantic Wall to hold up the attackers - and allow us to bring our panzers up to counter-attack."
ger.6.t:0 "Marshal Rundstedt's Strategy"
ger.6.d:0 "Based on his experiences opposing Operation Husky and the landings in Sicily and Italy, Gerd von Rundstedt was all too familiar with the nature of Allied air and naval supremacy.\n\nAs such, he believed that any counter offensive by the Germans on the beach would be obliterated with the help of these overwhelming advantages.\n\nRundstedt believed - with good reason - that the panzers which Rommel wanted to counter-attack would be destroyed by naval artillery.\n\nThus, Rundstedt wanted to hold the panzers back until the Allies had advanced beyond range of their mighty navy, and then counter once their supply-lines were over-extended. Following this, the Allies could be driven back into the sea."
ger.7.t:0 "The Compromise Of Strategies"
ger.7.d:0 "Seeing the merits in both Marshal Rundstedt and Marshal Rommel's plan, what Hitler did was to attempt to compromise. He supported Rommel's plan, but withheld the Panzers under his direct control - forbidden to act unless under his direct order.\n\nThis effectively nullified both plans, as Rommel's plan relied upon the Panzers being under his control.\n\nUnfortunately, Hitler's failure to support one plan led to what was effectively a watered-down version of both plans - which was doomed to fail."

[AEF.Getleader] has promised that both he and his troops will stop at nothing to free Europe from the Nazi yoke - and will pay any price to safeguard freedom.\n\nWhile it is still apparent that German holdouts exist in France, the Bulk of the Wehrmacht is in full retreat and appears to be preparing further defensive actions to the east."
new.5.a:0 "We will return."
new.5.b:0 "Freedom!"
new.6.t:0 "Belgian Liberation Declared!"
new.6.d:0 "As Allied columns press through Belgium towards the Netherlands and Germany itself, [AEF.Getleader] among other leaders of the Allied Expeditionary force have at last declared Belgium as a liberated nation. With its forces in exile already part of the A.E.F, the liberation of Belgium has allowed the country to formerly join forces with the Allies.\n\nAs the Germans withdraw from Belgium, it is clear that a great battle lies ahead. Hitler has with no doubt ordered [GER.Getleader] to mount staunch resistance, particularly as the Allies approach the Reich's heartland."
new.7.t:0 "[AEF.Getleader] appointed Commander!"
new.7.d:0 "A new figurehead for the coming Allied invasion of France has been appointed. [AEF.Getleader]'s experience has lead the Allied combined chiefs to appoint him as the Supreme Allied Commander. With this step, the Allies' dreams of liberating Europe come one step closer. Full preparations for such an invasion - and exactly where it will land - are still, however, to be decided.\n\nSpeaking to this newspaper, a spokesperson for the Allies said 'With the appointment of [AEF.Getleader], it is only a matter of time before the end of the German Reich and the liberation of Europe is declared.'" 
new.8.t:0 "Paris Flattened By Retreating Germans!"
new.8.d:0 "As part of new orders from Adolf Hitler, the Germans have laid waste to Paris in an attempt to slow the ever-advancing Allied forces.\n\nA spokesperson for the Free French forces called it a 'loss of culture and history the likes of which has not been seen in our history'. The Germans on the other hand have blamed the French 'acts of terror' by the FFI prompting a harsh response.\n\nIt is clear that Paris itself has been greatly damaged, and the bridges across the Seine also damaged.\n\nWhether or not this was a deliberate attack on civilian infrastructure, or a genuine military action, remains to be seen."
new.9.t:0 "Hitler Takes Control of [GER.Getname]!"
new.9.d:0 "In an apparent command reshuffle, Hitler has dismiased the old commander of [GER.Getname], opting to instead himself take formal command of the organisation.\n\nWhile Hitler's credentials as a field general have come into question, perhaps his experiences in commanding (and as some would say, meddling) in the conduct of the war may have given him the confidence to take full control.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not this will galvanise morale in the German army, or prompt it to wither away entirely."
new.10.t:0 "Allied troops Liberate Luxembourg!"
new.10.d:0 "To an exultant crowd, Allied troops have earlier today won a major victory in Luxembourg. [AEF.Getleader] spoke in a public address to his troops, calling it 'yet another victory' in the Allied quest to liberate Europe.\n\nIt is now clear that the Germans are on the retreat from the Benelux. Yet, the final battle for Germany yet remains - the outcome of this remaining unclear."
new.11.t:0 "Soviet Advance Resumes!"
new.11.d:0 "Following great objections from the Allies, the Soviets are resuming their nigh unstoppable advance from Germany into Northern France. Reports indicate that Hitler himself has fled Germany and arrived somewhere in France to resume command of what remains of the German Reich.\n\nTo an outside observer, it would appear that [OKW.GetNameDef]'s days are numbered. And as Hitler and [OKW.Getleader] order a furious last stand, only time will tell the true outcome of the war."
new.12.t:0 "Allied Forces Launch New Operation!"
new.12.d:0 "A new grand operation is being undertaken in France by Allied forces. Codenamed Dragoon, this operation, it transpires, is a full-scale Allied invasion of southern France.\n\nCarried out in conjunction with American and Free French forces, a significant number of troops have landed in Free France and, with the weakened German resistance there, are making swift gains. As the Germans reel and Hitler orders fresh counter-attacks, it would appear at an Allied army group will imminently arrive into the Northern French theater any day now."
new.12.a:0 "A mere setback."
new.12.b:0 "The Allies are coming!"

ending_allied_collapse_text:0 "Unable to control the intense pressures from the varying opinions and characters of the Allied Expeditionary Force, the entire venture eventually collapses as commanders and organisers squabble amongst each other. A unified and coherent invasion of Europe is, at this point, impossible.\n\nWith the total collapse of planning for Overlord, the Germans would have been able to immediately relocate a large number of units to the Eastern Front to 'revolutionise' the situation there. Given the fact that the Allies, in particular the United States, were still supplying the Soviets with a massive amount of weapons, equipment, and vehicles, it is unlikely that this would have made a difference to the outcome of the war for Germany.\n\nThe key difference in this outcome would be the state of Europe. With no Allied force to counteract them, the Soviets would likely push through and 'liberate' the entirety of mainland Europe.It is likely that, with their exhausted armies and crippled post-war economy, the SOviets would have had to aquiesce to the Allies who, not having suffered a mainland European invasion, would still be relatively fresh." 
ending_july_plot_success:0 "With Hitler and his fanatical Nazi followers removed from power, the path is now open to obtain a peace settlement, and to at least spare both Germany and Europe from continued suffering after many long years of war.\n\n With this development, Allied forces are able to move in and occupy Germany without a fight. The resulting peace conference is not dissimilar from the one in our timeline - albeit Germany remaining united as a singular democratic entity. With the Red Army 'liberating' the majority of Eastern Europe, it is unlikely the outcome for these countries would change.\n\nAs to exactly how Stalin would react to the entirety of Germany aligning itself with the Allies, retaining a good portion of its battle-hardened troops, is difficult to ascertain. Relations with the Soviet Union would be undoubtedly strained - and it is almost a certainty that Stalin would have seen this new unified Democratic front as a direct threat to his power. Let alone the prospect of a separate Allied-Germany peace which would have most certainly incensed him to the point of war."

While the effects of such reinforcements is not clear, it is likely that such an event would have merely delayed the inevitable German defeat. The failure of the Allies would do nothing to change the inherent problems in Germany, such as the shortages of fuel and the confused chain of command.\n\nEven if, with additional units reallocated from the west, the Germans were able to hold off the Soviets longer, into say the summer of 1945, the Americans would have simply dropped an atom bomb on Berlin.\n\nWithout the Allies landing and liberating the Western half of Europe, the door would be open for the Red Army to sweep in and take control of the entire continent. In this ineventuality, it is likely the Soviet Union would install communist governments across the continent, shifting the balance of the Cold War significantly."

ending_overlord_success:0 "The success of Overlord allowed the Allies a foothold in Europe, and eventually, the liberation of France and the low countries.\n\nThe largest cross-channel invasion ever mounted, the success of Overlord was followed by the pouring of millions of Allied troops into France. Demoralised, and with their ranks filled with foreign conscripts, the Germans find their troops surrendering to the Allies en-masse. As such, the Allies are able to advance at frightening speed across Europe and into Germany. Eventually, the Allies and Soviets meet, splitting Europe in two and setting the stage for the Cold War.\n\nMany would question the exact effects of Overlord on the outcome of the war, given its relatively close proximity to the war's end. The truth is that Operation: Overlord in the west, combined with a massive collapse of Axis forces in East, coincided to hasten the demise of the Third Reich.\n\nIt took a team effort to win WWII - a team in whcih every piece, no matter how small, had a part to play."
ending_allies_accept_soviet_europe:0 "With the AEF's failure to decisively defeat the Germans in the West, the Allies are powerless to prevent the Soviets sweeping across Europe, putting Communist and Soviet-aligned governments into power in all occupied countries. The options for the Allies in such an eventuality are slim, save one: launching Operation Unthinkable, and a full-blown war against the USSR. But without the support of their European friends, the rest of the Allies will have a tough fight on their hands - one they may not be able to win.\n\nIn the long term, the military and economic power of the United States, combined with Britain and their other allies in the rest of the world, would likely still be enough to outlive the spectre of Communism - as it did in our timeline. However, the effects of nearly half a century of Communism on various European states would be significant and long-lasting. Perhaps, this new and supercharged Eastern bloc may have been able to resist the collapse of the USSR and communism as a whole for much longer than it did in our reality. That is, of course, as long as the tensions created by the political developments at the end of the Second World War did did not come to a head in the form of a Third World War." #red alert soviet march theme
ending_unthinkable_allied_victory:0 "The failure of Operation: Overlord allows the Soviets to gain a foothold in Western Europe. Not willing to countenance a Europe under the totalitarian control of the Communists, the Allies launch Operation: Unthinkable.\n\n It is not completely 'unthinkable' (so to speak) that, in the event of the Soviets disregarding the interests of the Allies and occupying the entirety of Europe, that the former would be forced to take drastic action. However, after five or more long years of war, weariness in home populations of both the Allies and the Soviets could make any long-term warfighting plans fall apart.\n\nHowever, without the losses endured by the Allies in a greater European campaign - and against the prospect of an exhausted and over-extended USSR, the Allies' early successes in Operation: Unthinkable bely the great challenges ahead. Will they push into the USSR and attempt to remove Communism as a threat forever? Or will they settle for a mere containment of the Soviet Union, accepting to merely remove Communism from Europe? It is unclear."

Patton, this tremendous gamble has not paid off.Unable to break the Soviet defence, the Allies are forced to withdraw, and plan their next move. Will they settle for a Communist-dominated Europe, or continue the war elsewhere? A second failed European invasion would have triggered a large amount of war-weariness on the Allies' home countries, perhaps triggering a peace settlement. It is unlikely the Soviets would accept anything less than a completely Communist controlled Europe. In such a reality, it is undoubtable that the initiative in the Cold War would belong to the Soviet Union."#red army choir - victory day

ending_germany_beats_everyone:0 "Defying the immense odds stacked against them, Army Group B manages to not only stave off the combined might of the Allies and Soviets - but, taking advantage of the chaos caused by rising tensions between the two - actually manages to make gains.\n\n However unlikely a breakdown of relations between the Allies and Soviets during the war would have been, such an eventuality would have undoubtedly created a great opportunity for Germany to, at the very least, secure a conditional surrender. It is likely, however, that at this stage of the war, a German fightback was not likely due to the inherent problems that still remained in the country, of manpower, raw materials, and the leadership principle of the Third Reich.\n\nNonetheless, given the often-strained relationship between the Allies and Soviets, it is not too far-fetched to ponder a scenario where they end up at war with each other. What is far-fetched however, is the notion of the Allies conducting a separate peace with Germany in order to together face the Soviet Union. This notion is purely a notion of Nazi fantasy - the Allies were accepting nothing less than total victory."

With this newfound strength, the Germans are able to push the Allies back, create an opening in the English channel, and successfully invade the British Isles. Stunned by this counter-offensive, the Allies can do nothing but watch as Britain falls and the war in the west is ended conclusively.\n\n Without Britain in the war, and with the United States reeling, the possibility of an Axis vicctory becomes ever more likely. However, the unbridled power of the Soviet Union still lies to the East. With continued shipments from the Allies, the Soviets remain an almost unbeatable threat.

Without these sacrifices, Overlord may not have been the success it was.\n\nIt is also important to recognise the contribution to Overlord of all the countries of the Allied Nations.
